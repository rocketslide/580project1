I like to shop

An app that mines the Zappos inventory for clothing & shoes that I like.

How is this any different from searching Zappos proper?
What else can I do with the API?
	weed out the crap I will never wear
	


API key: 
	33fbe932da4708d8cf0439fbcb43cc428c16d8fa
	

This is what I wore, and I looked real cute.
